**This is my first big pet-project for practice ReactJS. It's a clone of one famous Pizza store.**

Here you can see this project's stack:
- **ReactJS 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit** (store data/pizzas)
- **React Router v6** (navigation)
- **Axios + Fetch** (fetch requests to backend)
- React Hooks (hooks)
- Prettier (code formatting)
- CSS-Modules / SCSS (styling)
- React Content Loader (skeletons)
- React Pagination (pagination)
- Lodash.Debounce
- Code Splitting, React Loadable, useWhyDidYouUpdate

I make it for myself practice, because now I'm studying in university and can't get a job. Thanks for watching!
